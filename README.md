MyTime - Android App (Project Skeleton)
=======================================
This ZIP contains a basic Android Studio project skeleton (Kotlin) for the 'MyTime' app,
plus a simple UI mockup image and instructions to build the app in Android Studio.

IMPORTANT:
- This package contains source code only (no compiled APK).
- You must open the project in Android Studio (Arctic Fox or later recommended),
  then build/run on an emulator or device.
- If you need an APK built, I can guide you step-by-step to build it locally or using GitHub Actions.

Files included:
- app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- app/src/main/java/com/example/mytime/MainActivity.kt
- app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
- app/build.gradle (module)
- build.gradle (project)
- settings.gradle
- README.md (this file)
- assets/ui_mockup.png (simple visual mockup)

Quick build steps:
1. Download and unzip this folder.
2. Open Android Studio -> Open an existing project -> select the folder.
3. Let Gradle sync. If Gradle versions mismatch, update Gradle plugin or Android Studio.
4. Run on emulator or physical device (enable developer options & USB debugging).

Basic Notes about the code:
- MainActivity contains skeleton for scheduling reminders using AlarmManager.
- The app uses Room for local storage in the full implementation; here we include placeholders.
- Customize notifications, icons, strings, and add more features per the MyTime design.

GitHub Actions CI (Build APK automatically)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/android.yml`.
When you push this project to a GitHub repository (branch `main` or `master`), the workflow
will run and build a debug APK. After build completes, the APK will be available as a
downloadable artifact under the Actions tab.

How to use (from a mobile device):
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one: https://github.com
2. Create a new repository (e.g., mytime-app) on GitHub.
3. On your phone, upload the zip contents to the repository:
   - Open the repository page -> "Add file" -> "Upload files".
   - Upload ALL files and folders from this ZIP (you can upload the ZIP and then unzip on a computer,
     or upload files directly via the GitHub mobile web UI).
4. Commit the upload to branch `main`.
5. Open the repository page -> Actions tab -> Click the workflow "Android CI - Build APK".
   The action should run automatically after the push. Wait for it to finish.
6. Once finished, go to the workflow run -> "Artifacts" -> download `mytime-apk` (this is your APK).

If you want me to prepare the repository files and instructions as a single ZIP (so you can upload them),
you already have that here. Upload the contents to GitHub and the CI will build the APK for you.

NOTE: The APK built by this workflow is a DEBUG APK. If you want a release-signed APK for distribution,
extra steps (signing keys and secure storage) are needed. I can guide you through that too.
